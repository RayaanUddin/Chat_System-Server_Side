# Chat_System-Server_Side (IN PROGRESS)
A chat system server program, which allows clients to communicate with another.

This is my first public project with java, in attempt to learn java syntax and create a console based messaging application. This is still an ongoing project.
Feel free to view the code to build upon or to review and give feedback.
